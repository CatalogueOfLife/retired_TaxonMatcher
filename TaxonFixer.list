# ---------------
# Taxon Fixer taxon list file
# Note that this file is executed, and must therefore contain valid Perl syntax
# (It is also a security risk - do not let anyone add arbitrary code to this file)
# (To be replaced by a proper Perl config file package)

# Version for Luvie's production run

# Name of file for logging (this over-rides the name given in TaxonMatcher.config)
$logFileName=     "TaxonFixer.log";

# List of taxon names whose LSIDs are to be re-created (Luvie's list):
@taxa= ("Axiidae", "Spengelidae", "Tethyidae", "Gigaspermaceae", "Cepheidae");
